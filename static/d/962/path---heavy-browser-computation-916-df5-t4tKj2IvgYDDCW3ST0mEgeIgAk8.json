Given this flexibility most of our computation has to be done in the backend, but not all of it. For the regular formulas that do not require HTTP requests to be fired, we could easily do them in the frontend.</p>\n<p>Currently we do all the computation on the backend, that means that even the “trival” operations such as <strong>SUM</strong> between two cells need to go the backend, and these are operations we, as users, expect to be immediate. </p>\n<h1>Optimistic Updates</h1>\n<p>One of the big challenges we have is what we call <strong>double computation</strong>. We want to do frontend optimistic updates to the basic operations (which do not include external requests) while still firing the backend requests to persist the computed values and then match and merge the results in the frontend.</p>\n<p>While basic users, usually have simple spreadsheets and their cell dependencies graph is rather simple, we don’t pose limits, and therefore the complexity of computation is unknown. If a user edits a cell that has a ripple effect that affets 1000 other cells, that will produce some heavy computation on the frontend. If we execute those operations by iterating a array of operations or with a recursive method, it will be a blocking operation and the browser will not be responsive during that process.</p>\n<h1>Requirements:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>No dropped frames, the page should be responsive at all times</li>\n<li>Processing should be interruptable (either for new data introduced or user wants to leave the page)</li>\n<li>Should be as fast as possible given the previous constraints</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How to access our solutions:</h1>","frontmatter":{"title":"Heavy browser computation at dashdash","subtitle":null,"date":"January 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"tags":[{"text":"react","link":"/tags/react/"},{"text":"typescript","link":"/tags/typescript/"}],"slug":"/2019-01-11---heavy-browser-computation/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-01-09---ts-extend-modify/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Typescript - Extending and modifying existing types with Mapped Types","path":"/ts-mapped-types","tags":["react","typescript"]}},"next":null}}
